# What is this repo
This is Vue projects scaffold it don't use Vue CLI.

# Why don't use Vue CLI?
If we use `vue create <projname>` , we can create Vue.js scaffold rapidly. But when we need customize project, needs to setup `vue.config.js` . This files knowledges are not enough now. So, I created Vue.js project to only use the webpack, this can use the knowledge of Webpack which we have earned over time.

# Where is test runner?
This is WIP :) Or you can setup to test runner by yourself.
